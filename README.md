In this file, you can find what each file was used for in the /Code folder.

create_test_data.py - used to extract 5 subgraphs from the full data
full_data_experiments - experiments on the full graph, but no feasible results
harmonic_function_networkx - used for the results of harmonic functions with gaussian fields
label_propagation*.py - label propagation algorithms for the 5 subgraphs
load_data.py - uses the OGB-python package to download the full MAG240M-LSC dataset
old_files - experiments and code that were not used in the thesis
plots.py - code for the figures in the thesis
preprocess_data_gcn_*.py - preprocesses the subgraphs for GCNN experiments
results - results of different node classification methods in txt-files
statistics.py - used for the table of statistics of each subgraph in the thesis
test_data_collection - data for each of the 5 subgraphs. Note that the largest dataset is missing, it was created directly at ukko2
test_data_experiments - data not used in thesis
test_data_label_propagation - data not used in thesis
test_data_old - data not used in thesis
