# MAG240M_Thesis
Here are the contents of the /Code folder.

full_data_experiments - experiments on the full graph, but no feasible results

old_files - experiments and code that were not used in the thesis

results - results of different node classification methods in txt-files

test_data_collection - data for each of the 5 subgraphs. Note that the largest dataset is missing, it was created directly at ukko2

test_data_experiments - data not used in thesis

test_data_label_propagation - data not used in thesis

test_data_old - data not used in thesis

create_test_data.py - used to extract 5 subgraphs from the full data

harmonic_function_networkx - used for the results of harmonic functions with gaussian fields

label_propagation*.py - label propagation algorithms for the 5 subgraphs

load_data.py - uses the OGB-python package to download the full MAG240M-LSC dataset

plots.py - code for the figures in the thesis

preprocess_data_gcn_*.py - preprocesses the subgraphs for GCNN experiments

statistics.py - used for the table of statistics of each subgraph in the thesis
